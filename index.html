            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I’m Leeiane Reine Bautista, a College student who is enthusiastic to learn and ready to try new things.
                I am a responsible and motivated learner who enjoys discovering new skills, especially in technology.
                I am interested in exploring computer applications and improving my abilities step by step.
            </p>

            <p>
                I may not easily understand everything at first, but I'm ready to face challenges that help me grow.
                My goal is to develop strong skills and prepare myself for future opportunities in the field of technology.
                I believe that learning is a continuous journey, and I am committed to improving every day.
            </p>
    
            <p> 
                I am someone who learns gradually, but I don't give up easily.
                I enjoy peaceful hobbies such as reading, watching movies and k-dramas, and playing badminton.
                My strengths include being patient, determined, and always willing to try everything. On the other hand, my weakness is that sometimes I don't understand the lesson quickly, but I'm always trying to get it.
